# Unlocking the Palate: Evaluating Taste Consensus Among Beer Reviewers 🍺

## Abstract

Navigating the world of beer reviews can be a daunting task for non-experts. Beer aficionados often describe brews as having nuanced flavors such as "grassy notes" and "biscuity/ crackery malt," with hints of "hay." But do these descriptions reflect the actual tasting experience? Following a "wisdom-of-the-crowd" approach, a descriptor can be considered meaningful if many, independent reviewers use similar descriptors for a beer's taste. To quantify consensus, we use natural language processing techniques to extract descriptors of a beer's taste and numerically represent these descriptors to compute similarity or consensus scores. The consensus scores between beer reviews will unveil whether there is a shared understanding of taste among beer geeks.

## 🔎 Research Questions

**WIP**: Do beer descriptors actually describe the taste of a beer?

## Additional Datasets

Our main project does not require any additional data and will rely entirely on the BeerAdvocate dataset. However, we have identified an interesting additional dataset that we might use further down the road. The [BeerConnoisseur](https://beerconnoisseur.com/) website contains expert reviews of beers. We could use these reviews for a multitude of interesting analyses, e.g. we could compute the consensus scores of experts and reviewers on the BeerAdvocate platform.
