## Unlocking the Palate: Evaluating Taste Consensus Among Beer Reviewers

### Abstract
Navigating the world of beer reviews can be a daunting task for non-experts. Beer aficionados often describe brews as having nuanced flavors such as "grassy notes" and "biscuity/ crackery malt," with hints of "hay." But do these descriptions reflect the actual tasting experience? Following a "wisdom-of-the-crowd" approach, a descriptor can be considered meaningful if many, independent reviewers use similar descriptors for a beer's taste. To quantify consensus, we use natural language processing techniques to extract descriptors of a beer's taste and numerically represent these descriptors to compute similarity or consensus scores. The consensus scores between beer reviews will unveil whether there is a shared understanding of taste among beer geeks.
