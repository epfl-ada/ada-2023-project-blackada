## Unlocking the Palate: Evaluating Taste Consensus Among Beer Reviewers

### Abstract
Navigating the world of beer reviews can be a daunting task for non-experts. Beer aficionados often describe brews as having nuanced flavors such as "grassy notes" and "biscuity/ crackery malt," with hints of "hay." But do these descriptions reflect the actual tasting experience? Following a "wisdom-of-the-crowd" approach, a descriptor can be considered meaningful if many, independent reviewers use similar descriptors for a beer's taste. To quantify consensus, we use natural language processing techniques to extract descriptors of a beer's taste and numerically represent these descriptors to compute similarity or consensus scores. The consensus scores between beer reviews will unveil whether there is a shared understanding of taste among beer geeks.

### Research Questions
Given the consensus scores for different groups of beers, we can answer our RQ. Our null hypothesis is that there is no correlation between beer descriptors and the actual taste, and therefore no consensus in the descriptors used. We can test this hypothesis by checking if the consensus score increases for finer aggregations, e.g. there should be higher consensus for Pilsner Urquell than for IPA beers in general.
