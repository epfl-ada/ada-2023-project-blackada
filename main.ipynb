    "Navigating the world of beer reviews can be a daunting task for non-experts.\n",

    "notes\" and \"biscuity/ crackery malt,\" with hints of \"hay.\" But do these\n",
    "descriptions reflect the actual tasting experience? Following a\n",
    "\"wisdom-of-the-crowd\" approach, a descriptor can be considered meaningful if\n",
    "many, independent reviewers use similar descriptors for a beer's taste. To\n",

    "descriptors of a beer's taste and numerically represent these descriptors to\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In our analysis, we apply various metrics to the rows of a TF-IDF matrix to measure the consensus or similarity within groups. A TF-IDF matrix represents the importance of words in documents within a corpus, making these metrics particularly relevant for text analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Description of Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cosine Similarity**: \n",
    "   - Ideal for comparing rows of a TF-IDF matrix, as it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. \n",
    "   - Effectively assesses similarity in terms of orientation in a multi-dimensional space, making it robust against differences in document length.\n",
    "   - Ranges from -1 (exactly opposite) to 1 (exactly the same), with 0 indicating independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence**: \n",
    "   - Measures the divergence of one probability distribution from another.\n",
    "   - In the context of TF-IDF, it can highlight how the word distribution of one document diverges from another.\n",
    "   - **Adjusted for Similarity**: We use $ \\frac{1}{1 + KL} $ to quantify similarity, with values closer to 1 indicating more similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Jensen-Shannon (JS) Divergence**: \n",
    "   - A symmetric and smoothed variant of KL Divergence.\n",
    "   - **Adjusted for Similarity**: We apply $\\frac{1}{1 + JS} $, where values near 1 suggest high similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Correlation (Pearson)**: \n",
    "   - Assesses the linear relationship between two sets of data.\n",
    "   - In TF-IDF analysis, it helps in understanding the linear association between the term frequencies of different documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implications and Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cosine Similarity** is highly effective in text analysis, particularly with TF-IDF where it accounts for the relative importance of terms in documents.\n",
    "- **KL and JS Divergence** provide a deeper insight into how the term distributions vary between documents.\n",
    "- **Pearson Correlation** offers an understanding of linear relationships in term frequencies.\n",
    "- Running metrics other than Cosine Similarity can be more computationally intensive but may yield other results than Cosine Similarity that was used for the main analysis. \n"
